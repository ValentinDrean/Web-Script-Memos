# leaflet-config-ajax-cluster

A custom leaflet configuration with plugin Leaflet.markercluster that makes it possible to have different color style from an ajax data range asset, applies on simple location markers and markerclusters.

It's also possible to calculate average of your ajax data for each markerclusters.

Personal additions :
* Ajax functions to recover data from community or from user
* Color style depending on data intensity to every location markers
* Average of all data in each markercluster and color style depending of its intensity
